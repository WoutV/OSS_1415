<p>
Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all constant names match a provided regular expression.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule when the regular expression value is "^[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*(_[A-Z0-9]+)*$":
</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  public static final int first = 1; // Non-Compliant
  public static final int SECOND = 2; // Compliant
}

public enum MyEnum {
  first, // Non-Compliant
  SECOND; // Compliant
}
</pre>
