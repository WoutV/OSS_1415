<p>Empty statements, i.e. <code>;</code>, are usually introduced by mistake, for example because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It was meant to be replaced by an actual statement, but this was forgotten.</li>
  <li>There was a typo which lead to the semicolon to be doubled, i.e. <code>;;</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>
void doSomething() {
  ;                                                       // Non-Compliant - was used as a kind of TODO marker
}
</pre>

<pre>
System.out.println("Hello, world!");;                     // Non-Compliant - double ;
</pre>

<p>Rarely, they are used on purpose, as the body of a loop:</p>

<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 3; System.out.println(i), i++);       // Non-Compliant
</pre>

<p>It is a bad practice to have side-effects outside of the loop body, and therefore that code should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i ++) {                            // Compliant
  System.out.println(i);
}
</pre>
