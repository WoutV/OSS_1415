<p>
This rule is meant to be used as a way to track code which is marked as being deprecated.
Deprecated code should eventually be removed.
</p>

<p>
The following code illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
class Foo {
  /**
    * @deprecated
    */
  public void foo() {    // Non-Compliant
  }

  @Deprecated            // Non-Compliant
  public void bar() {
  }

  public void baz() {    // Compliant
  }
}
</pre>
