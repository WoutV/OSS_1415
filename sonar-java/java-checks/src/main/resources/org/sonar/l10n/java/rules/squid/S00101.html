Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all class names match a provided regular expression.

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule when the regular expression value is "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$":
</p>
<pre>
public class MyFirstClass { ... } // Compliant

public class mySecondClass { ... }    // Non-Compliant
</pre>
