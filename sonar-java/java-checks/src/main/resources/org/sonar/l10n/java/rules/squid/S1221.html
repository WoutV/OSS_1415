<p>Naming a method <code>hashcode()</code> is either:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A bug. Overriding <code>Object.hashCode()</code> was meant and the application does not behave as expected.</li>
  <li>Done on purpose. The name however will confuse every other developer, who will think it is a bug.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the method should be renamed.</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
public int hashcode() { /* ... */ }    // Non-Compliant
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
@Override
public int hashCode() { /* ... */ }    // Compliant
</pre>
