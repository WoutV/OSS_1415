<p>
As of Java 5, <code>enum</code> is a keyword and can therefore no longer be used a variable names for instance.
Recent versions of the Java compiler will generate errors while compiling code still using <code>enum</code> as a name.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
public void doSomething() {
  int enum = 42;            // Non-Compliant
}
</pre>
