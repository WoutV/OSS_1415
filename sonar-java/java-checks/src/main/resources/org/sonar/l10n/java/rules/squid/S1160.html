<p>
Using checked exceptions forces method callers to deal with errors, either by propagating them or by handling them.
This makes those exceptions fully part of the API of the method.
</p>

<p>
To keep the complexity for callers reasonable, methods should not throw more than one kind of checked exception.
</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
public void delete() throws IOException, SQLException {      // Non-Compliant
  /* ... */
}
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
public void delete() throws SomeApplicationLevelException {  // Compliant
  /* ... */
}
</pre>

Overriding methods are not checked by this rule and are allowed to throw several checked exceptions.
