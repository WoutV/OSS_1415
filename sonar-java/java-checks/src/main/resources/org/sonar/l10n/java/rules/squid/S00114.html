<p>
Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all interface names match a provided regular expression.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule when the regular expression value is "^[A-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$":
</p>
<pre>
public interface MyFirstInterface {...} // Compliant
public interface mySecondInterface {...} // Non-Compliant
</pre>
