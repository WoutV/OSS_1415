<p>
The purpose of the Java Collections API is to provide a well defined hierarchy of interfaces in order to hide all implementation details.
Implementating classes must be used to instantiate a new collection, but the result of an instantiation should immediately be stored in a variable whose type is a Java Collection interface.

<h2>Noncompliant Code Example</h2>
<pre>
public class Employees {
  private HashSet&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new HashSet&lt;Employee&gt;();  // Noncompliant - "employees" should have type "Set" rather than "HashSet"

  public HashSet&lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees() {                       // Noncompliant
    return employees;
  }
}
</pre>

<h2>Compliant Solution</h2>
<pre>
public class Employees {
  private Set&lt;Employee&gt; employees = new HashSet&lt;Employee&gt;();      // Compliant

  public Set&lt;Employee&gt; getEmployees() {                           // Compliant
    return employees;
  }
}
</pre>
