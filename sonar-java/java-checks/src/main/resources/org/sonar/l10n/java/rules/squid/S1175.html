<p><code>Object.finalize()</code> is called by the Garbage Collector sometime after the object became unreferenced.</p>

<p>Overloading this method is misleading:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The overloaded method will not be called by the Garbage Collector.</li>
  <li>Users are not expected to call <code>Object.finalize()</code> and will get confused.</li>
</ul>

<p>Another name should be picked for the method.</p>

<p>The following code:</p>

<pre>
public void finalize(int someParameter) {        // Non-Compliant
  /* ... */
}
</pre>

<p>should be refactored into:</p>

<pre>
public void someBetterName(int someParameter) {  // Compliant
  /* ... */
}
</pre>
