<p>Two important requirements must be fulfilled when logging messages:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user must be able to easily retrieve the logs.</li>
  <li>The format of all messages must be uniform to enable users to easily browse them.</li>
</ul>

<p>
If a program directly writes to the standard output, there is absolutely no way to comply with these requirements.
That's why defining and using a dedicated logger is highly recommended.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule:
</p>

<pre>
System.out.println("My Message");  // Non-Compliant

logger.log("My Message");          // Compliant
</pre>
