<p>
Sharing some naming conventions is a key point to make it possible for a team to efficiently collaborate. This rule allows to check that all field names match a provided regular expression.
</p>

<p>
The following code snippet illustrates this rule when the regular expression value is "^[a-z][a-zA-Z0-9]*$":
</p>
<pre>
public class MyClass {
  public int FIRST = 1; // Non-Compliant
  public int second = 2; // Compliant
}
</pre>
