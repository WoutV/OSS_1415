<p>
Array designators should always be located on the type for better code readability.
Otherwise, developers must look both at the type and the variable name to know whether or not a variable is an array.
</p>

<p>The following code snippet illustrates this rule:</p>

<pre>
int matrix[][];   // Non-Compliant
int[] matrix[];   // Non-Compliant
int[][] matrix;   // Compliant
</pre>
