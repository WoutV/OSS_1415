<p>There are three reasons for a method not to have a method body:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is an unintentional omission, and should be fixed.</li>
  <li>It is not yet, or never will be, supported. In this case an <code>UnsupportedOperationException</code> should be thrown.</li>
  <li>The method is an intentionally-blank override. In this case a nested comment should explain the reason for the blank override.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following code snippet:</p>

<pre>
// Non-Compliant
public void doSomething() {
}
</pre>

should be refactored into:

<pre>
// Compliant
@Override
public void doSomethingElse() {
  // Do nothing because of X and Y.
}
</pre>

or:

<pre>
// Compliant
@Override
public void doSomethingElse() {
  throw new UnsupportedOperationException();
}
</pre>

<p>Empty methods not having any nested comments are tolerated in Abstract classes as those empty methods are usual when implementing the visitor pattern.</p>
